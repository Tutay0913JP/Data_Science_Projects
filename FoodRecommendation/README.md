<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

For many years, energy distribution has been directional, and electric suppliers have produced power in a scheduled and centralized system; thus, the electric grid have easily achieved stability of supply based on the demand most of the time. With the production of power from solar energy and the increase of prosumers, the instability of energy supply and demand can cause issues in the grids because the production of renewable energy can be high at some times but can also fluctuate and not be sufficient to match the demand. This challenges grid operators and regulators to balance the demand and supply and ensure fair pricing and access for all. If this issue is not addressed, this can affect consumers in general because operators can increase the transmission charges because of the high operational cost of maintaining the infrastructure and balancing the supply and demand. This also threatens the utility business model because of a potential revenue and market share reduction. 

This project aims to build a machine learning model that will predict electric consumption with high accuracy and efficiency will provide insights for individuals on their energy bills and also for electric companies to make informed decisions based on this analysis. By forecasting the demand, electric companies will be able to reduce the waste of energy supply and efficiently plan for demand and supply, enabling effective planning and energy.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

It can be overwhelming to pick good quality food because of the wide range of options from restaurants and meal delivery to grocery stores. Moreover, determining food and recipes for a balanced diet and avoiding junk food is daunting, leading to decision fatigue and poor food selection. Businesses in the food industry can leverage information on nutritional content, ingredients, and user reviews and build a food and recipe recommendations engine using a machine learning algorithm, which is important for: 

•	Providing users with the ability to discover food that aligns with their dietary needs, allergy restrictions, and food preferences. 

•	Offering healthier alternatives based on user fitness and nutritional goals. 

•	Allowing users to explore a range of food options to expand their dietary choices. The goal is to promote a good diet and encourage consistency in selecting healthier options to help 
consumers live longer and healthier lives.

The outcome of this project can also be integrated into businesses to enhance customer experience and drive business growth.

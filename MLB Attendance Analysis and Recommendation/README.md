### Summary and Conclusion
Based on the data and analysis above, we can conclude that these factors influence high attendance:

The game is a season opener
The game is more favorable at night
As expected, games with clear skies and pleasant weather averaging 65 - 80 temp have higher attendance
Top Dodger's opponents: Angels, Mets , Nationals have higher crowd attendance.
Lastly, bobblehead giveaways are very popular, which draw higher attendance.
With the use of data, we can make a recommendation to management on how to improve attendance with the following:

Games with opponents that have less attendance can increase attendance if the game includes popular giveaways/promotions such as bobbleheads. This is also true for last months of the season as they appear to have low attenance compare to start-mid season.
Consider having night games more frequently.
Look at the previous year/historical weather forecast to ensure an average of 65-80 temperature when scheduling games.
The shirt and cap are the least favorable giveaway; consider replacing them with something new to invite a bigger crowd.

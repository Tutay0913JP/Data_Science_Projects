<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The analysis aimed to uncover patterns and relationships within ALS patient data by combining K-means clustering and PCA. The silhouette score plot was used to determine the optimal number of clusters, and a K-means model was applied to assign cluster labels to the data. PCA was then employed to reduce the dimensionality of the data for visualization. The scatterplot of the PCA-transformed data with cluster colors provides insights into the grouping of ALS patients based on the identified features. The visual representation aids in understanding potential clusters or patterns that may exist in the data.
In this project, I used the historical data for Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and performed a k-means clustering model to uncover groups of similar patterns within ALS dataset using Python programming.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Problematic Internet Use (PIU) among children and young people, commonly referred to as internet addiction, is growing. Without proper guidance and filtering, kids may be exposed to inappropriate content, cyberbullying, and online games. In addition, social media sites have algorithms designed to keep users more engaged, making our young individuals more vulnerable to unhealthy internet usage. 
The objective of this project includes:
•	Explore data trends by looking at demographic, physical, and fitness measures and how they correlate with a child’s severity impairment index (sii), a standard measure of problematic internet use.
•	Implement a machine learning algorithm to predict the Severity Impairment Index (sii).
•	Determine the variable that most impacts youth’s problematic internet usage (PIU).
•	Possibly implement unsupervised machine learning algorithm to identify patterns to detect problematic internet usage (PIU) by clustering users. This may allow further research to identify risk groups and understand the underlying characteristics of problematic internet use. 
The outcome of this project can be used as proactive measures that enable educators and health care professionals to implement early interventions for young individuals by identifying potential problematic internet users before their behavior becomes severe by analyzing patterns in the early stages of online activity.

### Conclusion

Conclusion 
The machine learning classification model is able to predict the Severity Impairment Index (SII). The Decision Tree algorithm shows a good fit when predicting SII with the following 
results: 
  Decision Tree: 
* Training Accuracy: 100.0, Train Recall: 100.0, Train F1: 100.0
* Test Accuracy: 98.73417721518987, Test Recall: 98.73417721518987, Test F1: 98.71815921095312 

However, the classification model achieves 100% accuracy on training data and indicates overfitting. This needs to be looked at further and might require dataset to be increased to 
more representative data.
